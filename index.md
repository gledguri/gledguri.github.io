# Welcome

This is **Gledis Guri**, a passionate marine biologist with a strong background in marine spatial analysis, fieldwork techniques, and advanced ecological data analysis. Currenlty I am a postdoctoral researcher in Marine Biology currently sitting at [Kelly Lab](http://kellyresearchlab.com) at University of Washington. Over the past five years, my research has focused on expanding the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding as a tool to assess marine anthropogenic impacts and, more recently, to enhance stock assessments. My work increasingly incorporates Bayesian models, opening up new possibilities for integrating eDNA data into broader ecological frameworks. I created this website for three main purposes: to connect with colleagues (and provide a simple way to share my contact information as I move between research positions), to share my R packages and tools for addressing ecological questions, and to describe my articles in a clearer, more accessible languageâ€”while also sharing my articles free of charge.
