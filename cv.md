## Education

**Feb 2021 – Jan 2024**  
**Doctor of Philosophy in Marine Biology**, Institute of Marine Research, Norway  
PhD research focused on advancing the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for ecological studies, with a particular emphasis on fish communities. Worked with eDNA metabarcoding, qPCR, ddPCR data coupling with traditional surveys such as trawl catch.

**Aug 2018 – Jun 2020**  
**Master of Science in Marine Biology**, Arctic University of Tromsø, Norway  
Master's studies focused on marine ecology, marine climate change, field studies, advanced ecological statistics, environmental DNA. Provided an overview of arctic marine taxonomy and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Developed the ability to carry out research projects in marine ecology and to perform research fieldwork.  
Master's thesis: Researched how aquaculture affects ecological biodiversity using eDNA metabarcoding assessment methods.

**Aug 2010 – Jun 2016**  
**Bachelor of Science in Sustainable Coastal Management**, NOVIA University of Applied Sciences, Finland  
Focused on Baltic Sea marine biology, environmental impact assessments (EIA), marine protected areas, statistics, GIS, and environmental management of coastal areas.
