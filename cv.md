## Education

**Feb 2021 – Jan 2024**  
**Doctor of Philosophy in Marine Biology**, Institute of Marine Research, Norway  
PhD research focused on advancing the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for ecological studies, with a particular emphasis on fish communities. Worked with eDNA metabarcoding, qPCR, ddPCR data coupling with traditional surveys such as trawl catch.

**Aug 2018 – Jun 2020**  
**Master of Science in Marine Biology**, Arctic University of Tromsø, Norway  
Master's studies focused on marine ecology, marine climate change, field studies, advanced ecological statistics, environmental DNA. Provided an overview of arctic marine taxonomy and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Developed the ability to carry out research projects in marine ecology and to perform research fieldwork.  
Master's thesis: Researched how aquaculture affects ecological biodiversity using eDNA metabarcoding assessment methods.

**Aug 2010 – Jun 2016**  
**Bachelor of Science in Sustainable Coastal Management**, NOVIA University of Applied Sciences, Finland  
Focused on Baltic Sea marine biology, environmental impact assessments (EIA), marine protected areas, statistics, GIS, and environmental management of coastal areas.

## Working Experience

**Feb 2021 – Jan 2024**
**PhD in Marine Biology**, Institute of Marine Research, Norway  
During the PhD research, I optimized sampling designs for detecting fish community compositional changes, developed innovative Bayesian models to analyze eDNA metabarcoding data for multiple fish species, and conducted a thorough analysis of seasonal variations in fish communities in the context of climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Gained valuable experience in data analysis, modelling, and ecological research, and developed a passion for using cutting-edge techniques to address critical environmental challenges.

**Aug 2019 – Dec 2019**
**Project-based Research Assistant**, UiT Genetics, Norway  
Mapping of vertebrate composition through a (eDNA) metabarcoding approach in Greenland. Conducted DNA extractions, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing from sediment and water samples. Completed thorough advanced statistical analysis on how abiotic environmental variables shapes the composition of vertebrates. 

**June 2016 – Dec 2016**  
**GIS Worker and Project Assistant**, AquaBiota Water Research, Sweden  
Worked with habitat modelling and mapping of marine habitats in Gårdskär, Uppsala County and I am co-author of its project report. Also worked with the development of various GIS models and spatial calculations to develop a framework for marine nature value assessment and review of marine protected areas (MPA). Assisted and contributed to the development of a framework for the identification of marine nature conservation and ecological representative networks on behalf of the Swedish Maritime Administration. Also worked with the development of wave exposure maps for the Swedish coast.

**Mar 2016 – June 2016**  
**GIS Internship and Project Assistant**, AquaBiota Water Research, Sweden  
Worked as a project research assistant collecting literature on offshore wind power effects in the marine environment and at the same time developed a framework for spatial quantification of offshore wind power impact scale within GIS.

**May 2015 – Jan 2016**  
**GIS Internship and Project Assistant**, Novia Yrkeshögksolan Research and Development, Finland  
Designed an assessment plan for marine protected areas based on spatial quantification of the nature-value areas for Raseborgs municipality coastal waters through algae distribution using GIS analysis. I developed GIS toolkits for empirically calculating wave exposure and coastal isolation indices for Baltic sea coastal areas.
